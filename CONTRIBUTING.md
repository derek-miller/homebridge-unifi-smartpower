## Setup Development Environment

To develop Homebridge plugins you must have Node.js 12 or later installed, and a modern code editor such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This plugin uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to make development easier and comes with pre-configured settings for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and ESLint. If you are using VS Code install these extensions:

- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

## Install Development Dependencies

Using a terminal, navigate to the project folder and run this command to install the development dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Build Plugin

TypeScript needs to be compiled into JavaScript before it can run. The following command will
compile the contents of your [`src`](./src) directory and put the resulting code into the `dist`
folder.

```
npm run build
```

## Link To Homebridge

Run this command so your global install of Homebridge can discover the plugin in your development environment:

```
npm link
```

You can now start Homebridge, use the `-D` flag so you can see debug log messages from the plugin:

```
homebridge -D
```

## Watch For Changes and Build Automatically

If you want to have your code compile automatically as you make changes, and restart Homebridge
automatically between changes, you first need to add your plugin as a platform in `./config/config.json`:

```
{
...
    "platforms": [
        {
            "name": "Config",
            "port": 8581,
            "platform": "config"
        },
        {
            "name": "UniFi SmartPower",
            "platform": "UniFiSmartPower"
            //... any other options, as listed in config.schema.json ...
        }
    ]
}
```

and then you can run:

```
npm run watch
```

This will launch an instance of Homebridge in debug mode which will restart every time you make a
change to the source code. It will load the config stored in the default location under
`~/.homebridge`. You may need to stop other running instances of Homebridge while using this command
to prevent conflicts. You can adjust the Homebridge startup command in the
[`nodemon.json`](./nodemon.json) file.

## Versioning

Given a version number `MAJOR`.`MINOR`.`PATCH`, such as `1.4.3`, increment the:

1. **MAJOR** version when you make breaking changes to the plugin,
2. **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
3. **PATCH** version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

You can use the `npm version` command to help you with this:

```bash
# major update / breaking changes
npm version major

# minor update / new features
npm version minor

# patch / bugfixes
npm version patch
```

#### Publishing Beta Versions

You can publish _beta_ versions of this plugin for other users to test before you release it to everyone.

```bash
# create a new pre-release version (eg. 2.1.0-beta.1)
npm version prepatch --preid beta

# publish to @beta
npm publish --tag=beta
```

Users can then install the _beta_ version by appending `@beta` to the install command, for example:

```
sudo npm install -g homebridge-unifi-smartpower@beta
```
